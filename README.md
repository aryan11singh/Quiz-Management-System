##  Data Science & Analytics Capabilities

This project implements all core competencies required in professional Data Science and Analytics roles:

### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing (SQL & Pandas)
- Automatic extraction of relational attempt logs from SQLite into **Pandas DataFrames**.
- Automated type conversions, datetime parsing, and null-safety verification.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Summary Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (66.56%), Median (70.00%), Standard Deviation (21.95%), Interquartile Range (IQR = 30.00%), Minimum/Maximum scores.
- **Statistical Correlations (Pearson's $r$):**
  - Hints Requested vs. Final Score ($r \approx -0.81$): Identifies cognitive difficulty patterns.
  - Completion Duration vs. Final Score ($r \approx -0.75$): Analyzes pacing and conceptual struggle.
  - Hints Requested vs. Duration ($r \approx +0.35$): Measures active engagement duration added by hints.
- **Competency Segmentation:** Automatic categorical binning into *Distinction (75-100%)*, *Competent (50-74%)*, and *Needs Improvement (<50%)*.

### 3. Publication-Grade Visual Analytics (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
The interactive dashboard provides real-time visualization of:
- **Score Distribution (KDE & Histogram):** Visualizes performance variance with Mean and Median reference thresholds.
- **Completion Time vs. Score Percentage:** Multi-class scatter plot with linear regression trendline indicating pass/fail boundaries.
- **Hint Usage Impact (Boxplot):** Statistical boxplot demonstrating how hint frequency affects score spread.
- **Competency Tier Breakdown (Donut Chart):** Proportional breakdown of learner classifications.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Complete matrix quantifying engagement behavior vs. outcome.

##  Key Talking Points for Technical Interviews

When explaining this project in an interview or viva:
1. **End-to-End Ownership:** *"I developed both the operational data collection application and the downstream analytics pipeline. User actions like hints taken and time elapsed are captured in SQLite and analyzed using Pandas and Seaborn."*
2. **Statistical Rigor:** *"Rather than looking at simple averages, I computed standard deviation, IQR, and Pearson correlation coefficients ($r \approx -0.81$ between hints and score) to identify where students experience conceptual bottlenecks."*
3. **Business & Educational Impact:** *"The analytics dashboard allows course coordinators to identify challenging questions and segment learners into competency tiers for targeted intervention."*
